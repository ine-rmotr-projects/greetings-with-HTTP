### [HTTP Using Python](https://my.ine.com/course/http-using-python/5279105b-904b-496c-bb42-8805ddb52462)

# Greetings with HTTP

In this exercise, you will need to construct a function that communicates with port 2551 on `localhost`, and to the resource path `/stream` that may be queried with a GET method.  

As in the example shown in the lesson, data will arrive relatively slowly as lines; but in the server running for this exercise, it will continue infinitely.  You wish to terminate the session from the client side after a greeting longer than 20 characters is encountered. This will take a variable number of lines, since the greetings are randomized. Moreover, your function should itself be a generator function that will basically proxy the server's response.
